            <h2>What is BMR?</h2>
            <h3>An Introduction to BMR</h3>
            <p><em>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</em>, is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic functions at rest, like breathing, circulation, and cell production. Your BMR can be influenced by several factors such as age, weight, height, and gender, and it serves as the foundation for your daily energy needs.</p>
            <h3>Why is BMR important?</h3>
            <p>Knowing your BMR helps you make smarter decisions about your nutrition and lifestyle. Whether you're aiming to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply maintain your current health, understanding your calorie needs is the first step toward taking control of your goals.</p>
            <h2>How do I gain/lose weight using my BMR?</h2>
            <p>You can use your BMR to calculate how many calories to eat while on your weight loss/gain journey. To calculate, formulas have been provided for you.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>For weight loss:</dt>
                <dd>Multiply your BMR by 0.8 to get the number of calories you should consume daily to lose weight.</dd>
                <dt>For weight gain:</dt>
                <dd>Multiply your BMR by 1.2 to get the number of calories to consume daily to gain weight.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p><b>Remember, this is a general guideline and not an accurate representation of the amount of calories to consume.</b></p>
            <h2>How accurate is BMR?</h2>
            <p>We usually calculate using formulas, which are not always accurate. If you want the most accurate results, checking with a doctor would be the most reasonable option. Among the available formulas, the <b>Mifflin-St Jeor Formula</b> would be the best among healthy adults. Especially because it accounts for many factors accurately compared to older formulas.</p>
            <h2>Tips to Boost your BMR</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build muscle:</strong> Strength training increases your resting metabolic rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay active:</strong> Regular movement throughout the day helps keep your metabolism engaged.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat enough protein:</strong> Protein-rich foods require more energy to digest and support muscle maintenance.</li>
                 <li><strong>Get quality sleep:</strong> Poor sleep can negatively affect hormones that regulate metabolism.</li>
                 <li><strong>Avoid crash diets:</strong> Severely restricting calories can slow down your BMR over time.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Definition & Purpose of BMR</h3>
                <p>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the amount of calories your body needs to perform vital functions, such as breathing, circulation, cell production, and temperature management at rest. So essentially, BMR is the minimum amount of calories your body needs to function properly and survive.</p>
                <h3>What Influences BMR?</h3>
                <p>BMR is not a fixed value. Based on several factors, BMR can change greatly. Some of these factors include height, weight, age, and gender. For example, individuals with more lean body muscle need to consume more<sup><a href="#iTb-fn2">2</a></sup> because their muscle tissue consume more energy, even at rest.</p>
                <p>Here is a list of factors that influence BMR.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age</li>
                    <li>Weight</li>
                    <li>Gender</li>
                    <li>Height</li>
                    <li>Pregnancy</li>
                    <li>Hormones</li>
                    <li>Genetics</li>
                    <li>Temperature Exposure</li>
                    <li>Illness</li>
                    <li>Medications</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How is BMR Calculated?</h3>
                <p>In a clinical setting, BMR is calculated after your body goes into a complete state of rest, is in a thermoneutral environment (not too hot nor too cold), and after a period of fasting. These conditions ensure that digestion and physical activity do not intefere with diagnosis.</p>
                <p>However, in a general setting, like your home. You will not have access to such clinical-grade technology. In this case, formulas are your best option. There are several formulas to choose from, like the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula, or the Harris-Benedict Formula<sup><a href="#iTb1-fn1">1</a></sup>, which both use age, height, and weight to estimate. But the most accurate formula would be the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula.</p>
                <h3>Why Does BMR Matter?</h3>
                <p>BMR is essential for managing health and weight.</p>
                <h3>Why Does BMR Matter?</h3>
                <p>BMR is essential for managing your health, nutrition, and weight effectively.</p>
                <p>By understanding your BMR, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plan meals effectively:</strong> Ensure you're eating enough to support vital functions without overeating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set realistic weight goals:</strong> Adjust your calorie intake to lose, maintain, or gain weight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve fitness outcomes:</strong> Align your training and nutrition with your metabolic needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid under-eating:</strong> Prevent fatigue, hormonal imbalances, and slowed metabolism caused by extreme calorie restriction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, BMR is your metabolic baseline. Knowing it allows you to control your energy intake more precisely and make smarter decisions about your health and fitness.</p>

                <summary><h2>How does BMR Differ?</h2></summary>
                <p>BMR is different from other but similar caloric need values.</p>
                <h3>BMR vs TDEE</h3>
                <p>The difference between BMR & TDEE are the ways it is calculated and what it tells us. BMR is the minimum amount of calories your body needs to survive. However, TDEE adds up to BMR by accounting for activity levels.</p>
                <h3>BMR vs RMR</h3>
                <p>The difference between BMR & RMR are also the ways it is calculated and what it tells us. RMR is typically measured under more relaxed conditions, and accounts for minimal activities (sitting, eating, or walking briefly) throughout a day. However, BMR does not account for minimal activities we do.</p>
